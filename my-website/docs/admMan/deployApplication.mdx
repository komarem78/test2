## Context

After fierce development/integration/testing/…, it’s time to deploy the application into the CodeNOW application environment. 

## Before you begin

- [Create new application and application components](http://codenow.danielsadek.cz/documentation/create-new-application/)
- Improve application components code

## Steps

1. Build a new component version
    - An application release has to contain only released components because it makes clear which fixed bugs and newly developed features are contained in a particular build.
    - A released component:
      - is tagged in git,
      - has updated its pom.xml descriptors,
      - is uploaded to the nexus artifact repository.
    - Developers can check the build progress in CI/CD Builds Overview.
2. See the result of code quality check
    - SonarQube is the most popular open-source tool for static code analysis and is integrated into CodeNOW. See more about the [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/). 
    - Let’s use the default oxus-java profile for quality check.
    - Code quality check is a good first-line measure to evaluate overall code quality.
    - Defining quality gateways help for first glance decisions on whether the code is release-ready.
    - If the code quality is too low, improve your code and build a new component version (STEP 1)
3. Repeat STEP 1 and STEP 2 for each improved application component
4. Create application package
    - Define application package version.
    - Select which components (and which version of components) to include in the application package.
      - An application package consists of individual component released builds with individual build versions.
      - An application package is merely a descriptor, so far no real deployment exists.
      - An application as an orchestration of components is delivered to the selected environment as the whole package.
5. Define deployment configuration
    - Select the target environment and application package version. 
6. Deploy the application. 
7. Check the application deployment status using CI / CD Deployments Overview.
