## Prepare local development IDE

- Clone code from the created git repository to your local machine.
- Use your favourite IDE and import the repository as a maven project. You must have:
  - an installed npm package manager https://www.npmjs.com/
- To run the project in local development setup, check README.md
  - For installation of the required npm modules, go to project root and run the command below
    - _npm install_
  - To start the project in development mode, run the command
    - _npm start_
